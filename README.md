# Trouble

This is a command line implementation of the board game **Trouble**. I created it to practice programming in java.

⚠️Warning⚠️ The game will not work as intended when run in an IDE's output window or a non-windows terminal. For the best experience, please run the game in the terminal on a computer running Windows.

## To Play

Clone this repository:

`git clone https://github.com/Ferrington/trouble.git`


Descend into the `/trouble` directory and build the program:

`javac -d target src/main/java/org/trouble/*.java`


Then run the program:

`java -cp ./target org.trouble.Main`
